PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
1.1 Project Overview
Automotive Technologies are providing improvised services to the driver’s safety and vehicle security under the umbrella of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). In the development of ITS, advanced Automotive Technologies shall play a crucial role in determining the overall experience of users by making it much at ease in terms of reducing the risk of road accidents, risk of cybercrime in the vehicle, buying a used car etc. It is often noted that judging the driver’s driving skill is subjective and is difficult to set a standard for driver’s skills. The modern approach to transportation system is focusing on rapidly evolving with the intelligent vehicles. High rise in recorded traffic density, road accidents and crisis faced in regulating the effective management of traffic control in urban and rural 4 areas have concerned us to develop a smart solution in context to ITS. 
The automotive industry has great expectations from these futuristic solutions to improve the safety of people and security of vehicles. It is observed that the users are shifting from individualistic approach to the data-centric approach based on OBD-II scanner to avail the augmented driving experience. In spite of the modern command, control, communication, computers and intelligent systems, we are still facing numerous calamities in which thousands of precious humans lives are lost in accidents. Therefore, it should be an immediate need to tackle the small scale yet serious issues using the state-of-the-art techniques. We are mainly focusing on analyzing the data which is collected from the vehicle using the OBD-II scanner and eventually providing the driver’s safety solutions. We aim to obtain the solutions by observing the blind-spots accurately and efficiently using pattern recognition techniques from supervised learning.
