PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
1.1 Project Overview

The automotive industry has great expectations from these futuristic solutions to improve the safety of people and security of vehicles. It is observed that the users are shifting from individualistic approach to the data-centric approach based on OBD-II scanner to avail the augmented driving experience. In spite of the modern command, control, communication, computers and intelligent systems, we are still facing numerous calamities in which thousands of precious humans lives are lost in accidents. Therefore, it should be an immediate need to tackle the small scale yet serious issues using the state-of-the-art techniques. We are mainly focusing on analyzing the data which is collected from the vehicle using the OBD-II scanner and eventually providing the driverâ€™s safety solutions. We aim to obtain the solutions by observing the blind-spots accurately and efficiently using pattern recognition techniques from supervised learning.
